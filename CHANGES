- Added E-Mail basic support.
  The support includes the notification and creation or modifying (adding
  comments) of tasks. Further modification of other attributes are currently
  not supported.

  1. Creation:
  You can now create new tasks by sending an email to a specific email
  address. The subject of the mail will be used as name of the new task. The
  body of the email will be used as the initial comment of the task.
  2. Modifying:
  You can reply to a message from plorma. The body of the message will be used
  as new comment in the task.
  3. Notification
  Every time a new comment is added to a task a notfication email is sent to
  all users in the nosy list. The current user will be added to the nosy list
  if he isn't already in it.
 
  See documentation for more details.
